        <p>Puppet is a tool designed to manage the configuration of
        Unix-like and Microsoft Windows systems declaratively. The
        user describes system resources and their state, either
        using Puppet's declarative language or a Ruby DSL
        (domain-specific language). This information is stored in
        files called "Puppet manifests".</p>

        <p>Puppet discovers the system information via a utility
        called Facter, and compiles the Puppet manifests into a
        system-specific catalog containing resources and resource
        dependency, which are applied against the target systems.
        Any actions taken by Puppet are then reported.</p>

        <p>Built to be cross-platform, it works on Linux
        distributions, including RHEL (and clones such as CentOS
        and Oracle Linux), Fedora, Debian, Mandriva, Ubuntu, and
        SUSE, as well as multiple Unix systems (Solaris, BSD, Mac
        OS X, AIX, HP-UX), and has Microsoft Windows support. It is
        a model-driven solution that requires limited programming
        knowledge to use.</p>

        <h2>ElectricFlow Integration to Puppet</h2>

        <p>The plugin interacts with the Puppet's shell trough
        commander agent, the Puppet utility allows you to perform
        different actions getting the same results that you would
        get from the web-based interface and command line. This
        plugin offers two main funcionalities, first the ability to
        run manifest files easily from a file or from a text-area
        when the manifest content can be placed. Second it can run
        any desired Puppet command, extending the manifests
        funcionality.</p>

        <p>ElectricFlow itself provides some advantages like
        parameters checking, easy functionality selection using
        only check boxes, combo buttons, historical log reports,
        procedure duration statistics, simple credentials
        attachment, real time analysis of the log been generated,
        among others.</p>

        <h2>Integrated Version</h2>

        <p>This plugin was developed and tested against Puppet
        Enterprise version 2.5</p>

						useful when rebuilding hosts, since new certificate signing 
						requests will only be honored if puppet cert does not have a copy 
						of a signed certificate for that host. If '--all' is specified 
						then all host certificates, both signed and unsigned, will be removed.

						fingerprint of a host's certificate. 
						[generate]: Generate a certificate for a named client. A certificate/keypair 
						will be generated for each client named on the command line. 
						[list]: List outstanding certificate requests. If '--all' is 
						specified, signed certificates are also listed, prefixed by '+ ', 
						and revoked or invalid certificates are prefixed by '-' 
						(the verification outcome is printed in parenthesis). 
						[print]: Print the full-text version of a host's certificate. 
						[revoke]: Revoke the certificate of a client. The certificate 
						can be specified either by its serial number (given as a 
						hexadecimal number prefixed by '0x') or by its hostname. 
						The certificate is revoked by adding it to the Certificate 
						Revocation List given by the 'cacrl' configuration option. 
						Note that the puppet master needs to be restarted after revoking 
						certificates. 
						[sign]: Sign an outstanding certificate request. 
						[verify]: Verify the named certificate against the local CA certificate. 
						[reinventory]: Build an inventory of the issued certificates. 
						This will destroy the current inventory file specified by 'cert_inventory' 
						and recreate it from the certificates found in the 'certdir'. 
						Ensure the puppet master is stopped before running this action</td>
